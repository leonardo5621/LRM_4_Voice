# Speaker Recognition
Repository for the project of an Access System Based on Speaker Recognition.

The Objective of this project is performing Speaker Recognition/Verification to control the access to restricted rooms.
# The Main Techniques Explored in this project are:
- Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients(MFCC) for the Feature Extraction from Audio Files
- Gaussian-Mixture Models with a Universal Background Model(GMM-UBM) for the Pattern Recognition

The techniques mentioned have been tested in the ELSDSR Audio Database, a False Rejection Rate of 0% has been obtained in 22 trials, and a False Acception Rate of 2% in 50 trials.

 # Requirements
 
 The Python packages which have been used for this project:  
- Python Speech Features
- sklearn 
- scipy
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pyaudio
 -pydub
